Repository with little side projects I have worked on over the years

Tiner (misspelled timer) - small windows form based timer, set in seconds, which pops up on the screen and stays on top until closed or reset. I prefer this to sound or alert based alarms when working.

MouseActivity.py - prevents the screen from being disabled by moving the mouse and switching on/off caps lock

HltvFantasyRolesCalc - The goal of the project is to help assign player roles once the team is selected based on the big and small bonus historical probability.
Usage: once a team is selected and confirmed open the role asginment window and hit the power view button, all the players should be shown at the side of the role window then run the script. It will click all the role buttons and get the odds using ctrl+a+v and do the calculation, assuming screen size of 2560x1440, needs adjustment manually for other sizes.

TTS - a more simplified self-made version of https://github.com/SietseT/ElundusCoreApp, also used https://github.com/chrisjp/tts for reference

Passwordchecker - simple console app to safely(as far as I understand) check if a password has been leaked using https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#SearchingPwnedPasswordsByRange
