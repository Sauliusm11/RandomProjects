# RandomProjects
Repository with little side projects I have worked on over the years

Tiner (misspelled timer) - small windows form based timer, set in seconds, which pops up on the screen and stays on top until closed or reset. I prefer this to sound or alert based alarms when working.

MouseActivity.py - prevents the screen from being disabled by moving the mouse and switching on/off caps lock

HltvFantasyRolesCalc -Work in progress, currently all the values have to be gathered manually, only the brute forcing of all the combinations is in the script. The goal of the project is to help assign player roles once the team is selected based on the big and small bonus historical probability.
Odds.xlsx is used to get expected values for each role of each player
The expected values are placed in Values.xlsx which is used by the script
